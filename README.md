## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### In many place, I use the name No_wonder,but in Github there is already a No_wonder.Well, that's ok ,so my name now is Nw-Nowonder.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on C# for same projects in Tsinghua University, but it's more often for me to read the e-mail 821170715@qq.com. Any qustions or advice for programming is welcome! Hope for your connection.
